Note: if the python command doesn't work, try python3

How to create the fortuneteller project:

# Create virtual environment:
python -m venv ./venv

# Enter virtual environment:
source venv/Scripts/activate

# Install django in our virtual environment:
pip install django

# Create fortuneteller project:
django-admin startproject fortuneteller

# Open project in PyCharm
File -> Open
Navigate to fortuneteller directory

# Activate virtual environment in PyCharm's terminal
If git bash is not your terminal (does not look like git bash)
ctrl-alt-s (goes to settings)
Tools -> Terminal
Set shell path to: C:\Program Files\Git\bin\bash.exe
source ../venv/Scripts/activate

# Configure python interpreter (bottom right) to point to the python.exe in your virtual environment:
path/to/venv/Scripts/python.exe

# Migrate
python manage.py migrate

# Start the server
python manage.py runserver
To stop the server, it's Ctrl-C

***************************************

# Create app randomfortune
python manage.py startapp randomfortune

# Add our new app to the settings.py file (in the INSTALLED_APPS list):
    'randomfortune.apps.RandomfortuneConfig',

# Create a urls.py in the randomfortune/
randomfortune/urls.py (leave it empty for now)

# Create the following file, which will be our html:
randomfortune/templates/randomfortune/fortune.html

# Create the view in randomfortune/views.py
def fortune()...

# Add code to randomfortune.urls

# Add path to fortuneteller.urls

# Server should now be up! Go to localhost:8000/random in your browser and it should work.
If it doesn't (like me), go through each step again and try to see why

#Now we want to have the placeholder dynamically update with a random fortune.
Add a fortune_list and context to randomfortune.views and pass the context to the render function.
Use random.choice(fortune_list) to select a fortune at random

# Update your fortune.html to read from the context with:
{{ fortune }}
